# CORE.Swarm.WebSamples
SDK samples deomnstrating how to call into the external Swarm Compute API from a node.js app using the [CORE.Swarm.jspkg](https://github.com/tt-acm/CORE.Swarm.jspkg) and [rhino3dm](https://github.com/mcneel/rhino3dm) NPM packages.

This repo serves as both a learning resource for CORE studio web development teams needing to call into Swarm, and a development environment to iteratively improve the Swarm NPM package.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repo
2. Run `npm install` in a terminal at the project root.  Make sure you're signed in to NPM to get access to the private [@ttcorestudio/swarm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ttcorestudio/swarm) NPM package.
3. Run `node <file_name>` pointing at one of the example files in a terminal.  The examples all `console.log()` the results that come back from Swarm.
